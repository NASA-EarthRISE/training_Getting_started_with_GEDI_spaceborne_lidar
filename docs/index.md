# â€‹Getting Started with GEDI Spaceborne Lidar for Ecosystem Applications
This four module training series will help get you started in understanding the testing capabilities of the novel spaceborne lidar technology, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), for vegetation related decision-making. The four courses will highlight global case studies using GEDI for vegetation monitoring (with brief mention of other applications), drawing on successful and scalable NASA-funded projects in regions such as Nepal, Brazil, Peru, boreal forests, Africa and USA and its use in tools such as Online Biomass Inference using Waveforms and iNventory (OBIWAN) and the SERVIR CArbon Pilot (S-CAP). These examples in how GEDI informs canopy characteristics, terrestrial ecosystems, biomass estimations for forests, deciduous, evergreen shrubland, grassland, or other vegetated regions will include hands-on analysis and exemplify how lidar was used to address real-world challenges faced by example project stakeholders

## Training Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to: 
1. Describe essential physical principles of lidar remote sensing and its sensitivity to biophysical parameters.
2. An overview of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar mission, its theoretical background and product details and future of the mission.
3. Interpret GEDI data products Level 1-4 across various vegetation types and test recommended filtering and processing techniques. 
4. Ability to search, select, acquire lidar data with recommendations for testing and applying data quality processing methods.
5. Methodological approaches for generating and validating canopy height, biomass, and other structural analyses of ecosystems with field and real-world use examples.
6. Examine several biomass estimation methods using forest inventory, airborne and spaceborne lidar involving Machine Learning and remote sensing data fusion techniques.
7. Use the OBIWAN (Online Biomass Inference using Waveforms and iNventory) initiative API to account for forest carbon and biomass across timelines.
8. Advanced GEDI application analysis of carbon stock change due to fire, logging, and deforestation disturbances in the Amazon.
