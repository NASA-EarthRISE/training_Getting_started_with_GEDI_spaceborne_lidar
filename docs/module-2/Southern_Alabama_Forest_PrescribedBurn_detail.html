I think canopy cover could hint at forest species composition, with lower canopy cover indicating more &#39;pure&#39; stands of longleaf, and greater canopy cover indicating mixed stands. Tracking total canopy cover overtime in a known longleaf pine stand could also give an idea of successional dynamics (longleaf is prone to convert to mixed or other forest types over time if regular fire is not present on the landscape). </span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Potential advantages to having these metrics: </span><span class="c13">Better understanding of forest composition, ecosystem type, and succession dynamics</span></li><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Potential applications now possible with this data: </span><span class="c13">Forest managers could use this data to track forest succession over longer time periods, or to possibly characterize longleaf pine stands.</span></li></ul><ul class="c0 lst-kix_16ojgqd5qi2g-0"><li class="c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">vertical canopy cover profile (cover_z) </span></li></ul><ul class="c0 lst-kix_16ojgqd5qi2g-1 start"><li class="c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Reason this data is valuable for prescribed burn management: </span><span class="c13">Although tree spacing in LLP forests may be relatively large, understory or ground cover may look different.

Various entities, including indigenous communities, recognized the benefits of using fire to preserve and encourage generation of longleaf pine ecosystems in the south. In Alabama today, various agencies employ Rx fire or support the use of Rx fire to manage forests, including the US Forest Service (USFS), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Alabama Forestry Commission, and the Alabama Forestry Foundation. Other agencies aim to conduct field conservation activities and connect with landowners on longleaf pine conservation and restoration, including the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Longleaf Pine Initiative and The Longleaf Alliance. Earthrise is currently partnering with TNC and the USFS to study post-burn vegetation dynamics and impacts of prescribed burning in Alabama.</span></li><li class="c4 c19 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c18">What: </span><span class="c17">Wildland fires, referring to all fires occurring in the natural environment, include both prescribed (Rx) fires and wildfires. Rx fires are planned and controlled fires used as a landscape or forest management tool. It can be used as a &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; to manage natural resources and wildlife, encourage forest regeneration, maintain native ecosystems, and to prevent large wildfires. In Alabama, burns must be supervised by a certified prescribed burn manager, have a written prescription that is witnessed or notarized, and obtain a burning permit from the Alabama Forestry Commission (AFC). </span><span class="c17">Comprehensive</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;planning is done before undertaking a prescribed burn, including an evaluation of weather conditions and plans for the methods that will be used for carrying out and controlling the burn, as well as planned fire breaks. It is often carried out by trained professionals or landowners using drip torches or chemical ignition using &lsquo;ping pong&rsquo; balls. Entities such as TNC and the Forest Service submit detailed plans for prescribed burns ahead of time, and will conduct burns at frequencies depending on the needs of the particular ecosystem.</span></li><li class="c4 c19 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c18">Where:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Rx burns are conducted on USFS managed lands and on National Park Service managed lands, wherever it is deemed appropriate for land management. The AOI represents an area where Rx burning was conducted by the USFS as part of a hazardous fuel reduction treatment, and as part of the Boggy Hollow Longleaf Pine Management Project (according to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation). This AOI was also burned in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2021, 2024, and partly burned in 2019, as part of the Conecuh National Forest Prescribed Burning Program and the Longleaf Ecosystem Restoration II Project. </span></li><li class="c4 c19 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c18">When: </span><span class="c6">The AOI burn date was February 19, 2023 (this burn was clearly visible using high-resolution Planet imagery). However, the AOI was also burned in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2021, 2024, and partly burned in 2019, as part of the Conecuh National Forest Prescribed Burning Program and the Longleaf Ecosystem Restoration II Project. Longleaf ecosystems benefit from frequent burning every 2 to 3 years (according to our conversations with the USFS and TNC), and the management history shows this.</span></li><li class="c4 c19 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c18">Why: </span><span class="c6">Although the AOI chosen is in Conecuh National Forest, which has several longleaf pine (LLP) management and restoration initiatives undertaking frequent Rx burns, management of LLP in other national forests in Alabama may not be resourced in the same way. My project team has heard from USFS and TNC contacts that there are currently not enough staff to conduct Rx burns, and so the frequency of burning may be limited by this factor. On private land, there are not enough landowners trained and qualified to burn their own land, and so they may rely on Forest Service or contracted professionals. People conducting prescribed burns do site visits to assess site conditions for burning, and may also revisit the site after a burn, which can be time-consuming, especially with a backup of sites to burn. Monitoring vegetation dynamics with remote sensing, such as Lidar, may provide supplemental information and a wider spatial coverage of information to forest managers ahead of or after a burn, reducing strain on staff. Using remote sensing can also help assess the impacts and &lsquo;success&rsquo; of Rx burns multiple points in time. Since the impacts or severity of a burn may vary spatially over the area, especially for large burns, it can be especially important to have a broader view, which remote sensing can provide. Similarly, Lidar can also be used to assess the same things related to wildfire.</span></li><li class="c4 c19 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17 c18">How: </span><span class="c6">(summary of &nbsp;previous description of GEDI data products relevance)</span></li></ol><ol class="c0 lst-kix_pdtgayeqtyiv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">GEDI variables related to fuels and topography, like ground elevation, biomass, and total plant area index, could be used to give information on fire behavior, such as spread rate or direction (important for planning risks and fire breaks ahead of a burn). </span></li><li class="c4 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">GEDI variables related to forest/understory structure, like relative height metrics, vertical plant area index profile, vertical plant area volume density profile, structural complexity index, and foliage height diversity index could also give a better idea of the fuel load in the forest, and could potentially differentiate between the effects of burning on these fuels versus on trees.

Fire was recognized as essential for sustaining longleaf pine ecosystems, and today agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Alabama Forestry Commission, and the Alabama Forestry Foundation continue to employ or support prescribed fire. Conservation initiatives&mdash;including the USDA Longleaf Pine Initiative and The Longleaf Alliance&mdash;work with landowners to restore longleaf ecosystems. Earthrise is currently partnering with TNC and USFS to study post-burn vegetation dynamics and the ecological impacts of Rx fire in Alabama.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c6">Wildland fire encompasses both wildfires and prescribed burns. Rx fires are carefully planned, permitted, and supervised by certified managers to achieve multiple goals: reducing hazardous fuels, regenerating forests, maintaining ecosystems, supporting wildlife, and preventing severe wildfires. Burns require written prescriptions, weather assessments, fire breaks, and approved ignition methods such as drip torches or chemical ignition. Entities like TNC and USFS develop detailed plans and adjust burn frequency based on ecosystem needs&mdash;longleaf pine systems typically require fire every two to three years.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c6">In Conecuh National Forest, Rx fire is a central part of longleaf management, with burns documented in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2019 (partial), 2021, 2023, and 2024 under the Conecuh Prescribed Burning Program and the Longleaf Ecosystem Restoration II Project. The most recent burn in the AOI occurred on February 19, 2023, observed in high-resolution satellite imagery. However, while Conecuh benefits from frequent burns, other forests in Alabama face staffing and resource shortages, limiting burn frequency. Many private landowners also lack the training or certification to conduct burns, relying instead on agencies or contractors. This creates backlogs in site visits, implementation, and post-burn monitoring.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c6">Remote sensing tools, such as GEDI lidar, can help address these challenges. GEDI data products provide information on fuels, forest structure, and canopy conditions. Metrics related to elevation, biomass, plant area index, and understory structure can improve planning, indicating fuel loads, fire behavior, and treatment needs. Post-burn, GEDI can help track vegetation recovery, assess effectiveness, and compare prescribed fire impacts with those of wildfires. By expanding monitoring capacity beyond field visits, these data can support more effective and frequent fire management in longleaf ecosystems.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17">Overall, GEDI (or other Lidar) could help to assess the need or frequency of burning, and to monitor post-burn impacts.</span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c4 c16"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">Potential condensed: </span></p><p class="c14"><span>Prescribed fire (Rx fire) has deep roots in the Southeast, first practiced by Indigenous communities and later by foresters in the 20th century to sustain longleaf pine ecosystems, while much of the West still suppressed fire.
